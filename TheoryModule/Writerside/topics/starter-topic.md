# About Design Patterns | Documentation

<p>Hello! <br/><br/>
The following file will present the most important information given out during our first meeting for Design 
Patterns. While this course appears to be language-agnostic, I hope to add into the mix a set of implementations for 
the Java programming Language as well as Scala whilst we study these design patterns.
<br/><br/>
Each of the following subsections will contain useful details be it about course materials, readings, scheduling, 
assignments, homework planning, etc. All in an effort to prepare me better to this class and take full advantage of 
what it offers.
</p>

## Course Description
<p>This course involves taking care of complexity, managing the interconnections between layers and sections of 
software, to make them <code>robust, extensible, manageable, and maintainable</code>, balancing complexity, 
modularization, extensibility and the ability for our code to be <code>plug-and-play</code>
<br/><br/>
These course involves collaborative development, working on projects to bolster not only our knowledge about design 
patterns, but also about communication, collaboration and resource sharing techniques to develop software solutions. 
<code>Topics often are given out, but the solution comes from our mind</code><b>(this of course means that there 
will be a rigorous grading system)</b>.
<br/><br/>
<code>My presentation about myself appears to have impressed the professor, I would like to connect with him given 
that he has worked on integrated systems, and embedded design.
</code>
