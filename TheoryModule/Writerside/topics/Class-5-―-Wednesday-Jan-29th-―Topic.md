## Choosing the right tools
<p>Often work in groups not only comes down to project management and a balance of power within the group, or the 
affinity of each other within the boundaries of this group, but to the tooling that is used to keep everything afloat.
</p>
<p>In my case, I am used to using github, workflows, and I am a documentation centric individual, while some others 
might not be that documentation centric. Moreover, and honestly sadly, I do not have a group as of the time of 
writing this. Therefore, I will try to keep the work that I want to do simple and to some extent educational when it 
comes to this area of computer science, project management, design, etc.
</p>
<p>The main idea here is to use github to manage the program and to keep branches for working both in UML diagrams, 
etc. Since Astah or Capella do not have GitHub integra</p>
