## Monday 3rd Class ― Choosing the right tools
<p>Often work in groups not only comes down to project management and a balance of power within the group, or the 
affinity of each other within the boundaries of this group, but to the tooling that is used to keep everything afloat.
</p>
<p>In my case, I am used to using github, workflows, and I am a documentation centric individual, while some others 
might not be that documentation centric. Moreover, and honestly sadly, I do not have a group as of the time of 
writing this. Therefore, I will try to keep the work that I want to do simple and to some extent educational when it 
comes to this area of computer science, project management, design, etc.
</p>
<p>The main idea here is to use github to manage the program and to keep branches for working both in UML diagrams, 
etc. Since Astah or Capella do not have GitHub integra</p>


## Wednesday 5h Class ― Robustness Diagrams

## Monday 10th Class ― Activity Diagrams
<p>An activity diagram can be though of as a flow diagram with added infomration. The idea is that 
<b><code>a use case shows what the system needs to do, but the activity diagram shows how</code></b>. It is meant to 
model processes and sequences of actions to complete a task within our system.
</p>
<p>Activity diagrams can be used to define both the main, and alternative, flows within our use case definitions. 
These diagrams can be used within software design or even business process analysis. </p>
<p>Activity diagrams often respond to either <b><code>external events that change the state or update 
some state within our application</code></b>, or they might respond to a method call, i.e., these two define ways in 
which an activity diagram can start.
